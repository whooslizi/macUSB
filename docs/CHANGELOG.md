# macUSB Release Changelog

---

## v2.1

macUSB v2.1 brings a new built-in macOS Downloader, improved helper reliability with automatic post-update repair, and a polished USB creation experience.

### NEW: DOWNLOADER
- Added a downloader module available from **Tools → Download macOS installer...** and from the analysis screen via **Download**.
- Added Apple-catalog installer discovery with grouped system families and an option to show all available versions.
- Added a complete staged workflow: connection, file download, verification, installer build, and final cleanup.
- Added installer verification based on package signature checks and data-integrity validation, applied according to system version and available verification methods.
- Added support for preparing installers across modern and legacy Apple distribution paths, including Sierra and older official Apple Support downloads.
- Added a completion summary with transfer metrics, destination details, and direct **Show in Finder** action.
- Added one-click handoff from downloader summary to analysis, allowing immediate use of the downloaded installer in USB creation.

### IMPROVEMENTS
- Helper repair is now more reliable and repeatable, especially in cases where macOS temporarily blocks or delays background activation, with more stable recovery after reconnection attempts.
- Helper repair is now presented as a system alert, improving UI consistency and making recovery status easier to follow.
- After updating to a new app version, helper auto-repair now runs automatically to ensure compatibility with newly introduced functionality.
- Minor UI polish during the USB creation stage.

---

## v2.0.2

This patch release improves installer workflow reliability by tightening USB target validation rules and strengthening recovery behavior in helper and source-analysis edge cases.

### CHANGES
- USB minimum-capacity validation is now dynamic and tied to detected installer generation: Sonoma and older require 16 GB, Sequoia and newer require 32 GB.
- Selecting an APFS USB target now blocks proceeding to the next step and clearly guides the user to manually reformat the drive in Disk Utility before continuing.

### IMPROVEMENTS
- Improved helper repair with clearer diagnostics and more reliable recovery when macOS blocks background helper activation.
- When a selected `.cdr` or `.iso` source image is already mounted in macOS, analysis now shows a clear system alert and instructs the user to unmount the image before retrying.

---

## v2.0.1

This patch release focuses on resolving installer creation failures by enforcing the required **Full Disk Access** permission for macUSB before critical workflows continue.

### FIXED
- Improved startup permission flow to clearly require **Full Disk Access** when it is missing, reducing cases where installer creation could fail due to insufficient system permissions.
- Added a direct shortcut in **Tools → Grant Full Disk Access...** to quickly open System Settings and grant the required permission.
- Added a warning on the operation summary screen when required permissions are missing (Full Disk Access and/or helper background permission), so the risk is visible before starting the process.

---

## v2.0

macUSB v2.0 introduces a refreshed interface with full support for the **Liquid Glass** effect, tailored to the modern macOS Tahoe aesthetic, and a new architecture powered by native system services that improves reliability and streamlines the installer media preparation process.

### ADDED
- Native privileged helper tool (**SMAppService**) to handle the installer creation process, ensuring higher stability and removing the need for external terminal sessions.
- Automatic USB media verification and preparation — the app now checks partition schemes and disk formats, converting them to GPT and Mac OS Extended (Journaled) if necessary.
- Interactive progress dashboard — a new screen displaying the status of all steps (pending, in progress, and completed).
- USB standard identification mechanism with low-bandwidth warnings for USB 2.0 devices.
- Real-time USB write speed indicator displayed during the creation process.
- Dynamic system icons extracted directly from the source files of the selected macOS version.
- System notifications for process completion (optional via **Options → Notifications**; delivered when system permission is granted and app-level notifications are enabled).
- Audio feedback signal played upon successful completion of the installer.
- Total operation time summary shown on the final success screen.
- Enhanced logging system covering file analysis and media preparation stages, including data export via **Help → Export diagnostic logs…**.
- Disk Utility shortcut located in the **Tools → Open Disk Utility** menu.
- Expanded language support: Italian, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and Turkish.

### CHANGES
- The language selection menu has been moved to the menu bar under **Options → Language**.

### IMPROVEMENTS
- Refined visual interface with the Liquid Glass effect, tailored to the macOS Tahoe aesthetic.
- Language switching now updates in-app UI immediately; full menu/system-localized UI refresh may require app restart.
- Added the ability to revert to automatic language detection after a manual override.
- Optimized the recognition engine for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger to improve source image detection.
- General UI text refinements and localization fixes.
